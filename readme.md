# Sebastian's Snake Game

### Introduction

This game was made with HTML, CSS and Javascript and was a collaborative experience with other students in Snapchat Engineering Academy. The goal of this project was
to display my abilities to code a fun beginner project with all three languages and gain experience using
[SnapKit](https://snapkit.io/). <br><br>

### Usage

Movement - Use the four arrow keys to direct the yellow snake through the map led by a Bitmoji head. <br><br>
Objective - Try to eat as many apples as possible, without crashing your snake on itself.
